# bioclash-informatics
"""
February 2025 - My name is Diego Reyes. After years of working in cellular and molecular biology, I am venturing into the tech world. Bioclash-informatics is a fun project to show off my skills!

I welcome input from all coders who have an interest in biology.

Bioinformatics role by the end of 2025 is the goal!
